<h1 align="center">Hey 👋 Welcome</h1>

<p align="left">
👋 Hi, I’m <b>Demirkan</b>, a recently graduated <b>Computer Engineering</b> student from <b>Riga Technical University</b>. My academic background and personal projects are strongly focused on understanding how complex systems work and turning that understanding into practical, well-structured software solutions.
</p>

<p align="left">
🤖 My main interests lie in <b>multimodal conversational AI</b>, <b>machine learning</b>, and <b>data-driven systems</b>. I enjoy exploring how language models, structured data, and classical machine learning techniques can be combined to build intelligent systems that are both explainable and useful in real-world scenarios.
</p>

<p align="left">
⚙️ I particularly enjoy working on <b>backend-heavy projects</b>, where system design, data pipelines, and model integration come together. Building scalable APIs, intelligent assistants, and end-to-end ML pipelines that go beyond toy examples is a core motivation behind most of my work.
</p>

<p align="left">
🚀 Most of my projects are driven by <b>curiosity and experimentation</b>. I like starting from an academic or theoretical idea and gradually shaping it into a <b>working, testable, and reproducible system</b>, paying close attention to data quality, evaluation methodology, and real-world constraints.
